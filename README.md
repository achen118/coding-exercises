## findImage(arr)
Imagine we have an image. We'll represent this image as a simple 2D array where every pixel is a 1 or a 0.

The image you get is known to rectangles of 0s on a background of 1s.

Write a function that takes in the image and outputs the coordinates of all the 0 rectangles -- top-left and bottom-right; or top-left, width and height.

## highestProduct(arr)
Given an array of integers, find the highest product you can get from three of the integers.
